# SpectralClustering
Flat file hierarchy for grading purposes :(

An optimized implementation of the spectral clustering algorithm using C and Python made with Michael Garbois. Heavy use of optimized NumPy functions and c code to lower the running time.

To run:

```
python3.8.5 -m invoke run -k -n --[ no-] Random
```

The program will generate multiple output files, including a visualization of the clustering using both the Spectral Clustering algorithm and the K-means algorithm.
